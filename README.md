# solarSystem

Implementation of solar system simulation.

Compile and run Main to see the simulation:

javac Main.java

java Main


Supports acceleration using 'f' and slowing down using 's' keyboard buttons.

Multithreading is used to optimize the program.

Planets' rotation variables are similar to the real-world solar system.
